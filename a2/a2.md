# A2

# Enhancements clarification
# A MultiMode is added:
# 	1. The mode can be abled or disabled by clicking the button on toolbar
#	2. Once MultiMode is abled, both 'draw' and 'select' are disabled. i.e. you cannot
#	   draw anything, and can select one or more items (in 'select', you can only choose one 
#	   item at a time)
#	3. In MultiMode, you can click on several items to select them together, or click some again
#	   to deselect. For all selected items, they will be handled with user actions together. For 
#	   example, in MultiMode, if more than one items are selected and then Delete button is 
#	   pressed, all of the selected shapes will be deleted at one. Same for all transform,
#	   setColor and setThickness operations.

# Extra note:
# 	It seems when tested on my computer, VK_DELETE is not a valid button as 'Delete' of my
# keyBoard. Instead, if I use VK_BACK_SPACE, 'Delete' button will actually do what it is expected.
# However, I'm not sure if this will happen as you test my program. So I just keep using BackSpace
# so that I can better test on my machine. Hopefully this will not result any mark off :) Thank 
# you.
